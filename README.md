## 🛠️ Setup Requirements

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

### Required Software:
- **Visual Studio Code** (latest version)
- **Docker Desktop** (latest version)
- **PowerBI Desktop** (latest version)
- **Git** (for version control)

### VS Code Extensions:
The devcontainer will automatically install the required extensions, but you may want to have the following available:
- Remote - Containers
- Remote Development Extension Pack

### PowerBI Requirements:
- PowerBI Desktop (free version is sufficient)
- PowerBI account (optional, for publishing)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <repository-name>
```

### Step 2: Open in VS Code
```bash
code .
```

### Step 3: Setup Development Container

1. **Open Command Palette**: Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac)

2. **Reopen in Container**: Type and select `Dev Containers: Reopen in Container`
   - Alternatively, VS Code may show a popup asking if you want to reopen in container - click "Reopen in Container"

3. **Wait for Setup**: The container will build and configure automatically
   - This may take a few minutes on first run
   - The setup script will install dbt packages and configure the environment

4. **Verify Setup**: Once complete, you should see:
   - Terminal with custom bash configuration
   - dbt packages installed in `transformation/dbt_packages/`
   - DuckDB CLI available
   - All required Python packages installed

### Step 4: Explore the Environment

After the container is running, you can:

```bash
# Navigate to the dbt project
cd transformation

# Check dbt installation
dbt --version

# Install/update dbt packages
dbt deps

# Test database connection
dbt debug
```

### Step 5: Start Working on the Case Study

📖 **Read the detailed case study instructions in [`INSTRUCTIONS.md`](INSTRUCTIONS.md)**

The case study includes:
- Data exploration requirements
- dbt transformation tasks
- PowerBI dashboard creation
- Business analysis objectives

## 🗃️ Data Overview

The repository includes a realistic banking dataset stored in the DuckDB database (`transformation/casestudy.duckdb`) with the following tables:
- **customers** - Customer demographics and branch assignments
- **accounts** - Account information linked to customers  
- **transactions** - All transaction data with multi-currency support
- **loans** - Loan portfolio with approval/rejection status
- **fx_rates** - Exchange rates for currency conversion
- **currencies** - Currency lookup table

See the Entity Relationship Diagram in `docs/erd.png` for detailed schema information.

## 🔧 Development Workflow

### dbt Development:
```bash
cd transformation

# Run dbt models
dbt run

# Test data quality
dbt test
```

### Data Export for PowerBI:
```bash
# Export data using DuckDB CLI
duckdb transformation/casestudy.duckdb "COPY table_name TO 'output.csv' (HEADER, DELIMITER ',')"

# Or use Python scripts for custom exports
python export_data.py
```

## 📊 PowerBI Integration

Since there's no direct PowerBI connector for DuckDB:
1. Export your dbt model outputs to CSV/Excel
2. Import the files into PowerBI Desktop  
3. Create your dashboard and analysis
4. Document your data ingestion approach

## 📝 Submission Guidelines

When you're ready to submit:

1. **Code Repository**: Ensure all your dbt models, tests, and documentation are committed
2. **PowerBI Files**: Include your .pbix files
3. **Documentation**: Add screenshots of key dashboard pages
4. **Summary**: Include a brief summary of findings and recommendations
5. **Data Ingestion**: Document your chosen approach for getting data into PowerBI

## 🆘 Need Help?

If you encounter any issues:

1. **Container Issues**: Try rebuilding the container (`Dev Containers: Rebuild Container`)
2. **dbt Issues**: Check `dbt debug` output for connection problems
3. **Data Issues**: Refer to the ERD and data documentation in `docs/`
4. **PowerBI Issues**: Document your approach and any workarounds used
